    <h2>About Luminous Candles</h2>
    <p>
        At Luminous Candles, our journey began with a simple yet profound belief:
        that the soft, comforting glow of a candle and the subtle embrace of its
        fragrance have the power to transform ordinary moments into extraordinary
        experiences. This belief is at the heart of everything we do.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Founded with a passion for craftsmanship and a love for all things luminous,
        we embarked on a mission to create candles that not only light up your surroundings
        but also light up your life. Our story is one of dedication, creativity, and an unwavering 
        commitment to quality. We're not just candle makers; we're creators of ambiance, and every
        candle is a testament to our dedication to this craft.
